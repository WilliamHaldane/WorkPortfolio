# WorkPortfolio
This is an e-portfolio that encapsulates some of my biggest projects, achievements and attempts to contribute to the common good while at the University of St. Thomas. 

In my time at the University of St. Thomas, I have changed majors, met new people, learned a lot about diverse subjects and perspectives and learned about a wide range of topics related to computer science. I came into my freshman year with aspirations to become a mechanical engineer. After about a year, I quickly learned that this wasn't where my passion. Having just taken a computer science class the semester before, I decided to take a few more and see how well they fit me. I quickly learned that I had a love for the problem solving skills computer science required and loved building a beautiful product from scratch. As I went on, I took classes like Object-oriented Design, Data Structures, Computer Architecture, Information Securities, Discrete Math, Algorithms, Web Design, Database Design, and more. From these courses, I was exposed to a wide range of studies and possible career fields within computer science. I took my senior capstone class in the Fall of 2023, where we worked on a web application for a private catholic school. From this I learned a lot about the use of APIs, databases, application programming and more. 

As I enter my final semester at the University of St. Thomas, I will be starting a research position. I will be conducting researcch with Dr. Thomas Hickson. Dr. Hickson conducts research on microbialites (rocks that form under the influence of microbes). He currently has a database full of samples and all sorts of information in Microsoft Access. He wishes to migrate his database to a PostgreSQL environment and build a front-end application which can display, export and add data to his database. I will be working with another student to achieve this project and I am very excited at the opportunity to learn more and grow as a computer scientist. Maybe most of all, I am excited to participate in research that is meaningful and has lots of positive impact and application to the real world. 

As I get closer to graduation I am thankful for all that I have learned at the University of St. Thomas both academic and not. I feel that I have grown immensely as a person and I look forward to applying my skills in the real world. 

+++++++++++++++++++PROJECTS I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT+++++++++++++++++++++++++

+++++DATABASE PROJECT+++++
One of the projects that I recently completed was in my Database Design I class. We had a semester long project where we worked to design, normalize, create and implement a database and a user interface. My group worked on a college book system. The idea behind our system was to give universities a better and easier way to sell, return and handle books which are required for the universities classes. The database would have employees who worked for the company in charge of the system. Each of the employees was assigned a user type; which was either customer service worker, administrator or super administrator. The university would have associated students, books, courses, departments, sections and more. The project was split into five phases. Each phase sought to complete one of the main parts of desiging and implementing a database. 

One of the large parts of the project was the planning of the database. For that, we used an ER-diagram to map out tables, attributes, keys and relationships. This stage was still subject to change, so this ER-diagram is not the finished design.

Throughout the rest of the project, we populated a database in MySQL and then wrote python to resemble a primitive version of a user interface. This part of the project required extensive programming within python. For each route within the system, we wrote methods to achieve things like writing to the database, gathering reports, deleting users, checking out books, adding users and much more. By the end of the project, we not only had a great understanding of programming and databases, but we also had a great understanding of how computer science topics can be applied. Specifically, this implementation was for the good of all people who might use it. Rather than have people waste time over a poorly run book system, our system offered the ability to save time, improve accuracy, and get better data driven insight as to what is happening with the database. This contribution to the common good relates heavily to the values and morals the University of St. Thomas preaches. I beleive that we acheived that mission in our project and I am excited to continue using my knowledge as a computer scientist for the betterment of society.

+++++SAINT PAUL CRIME TRACKER+++++

Another project which I also recently completed was a Saint Paul crime tracking website. In my Web Development course, I worked with a group of two peers to bring together the semesters concepts and a great looking and functioning website. The website connects to our own API and two other APIs to bring an interactive map of the Saint Paul region. The map has search features like filtering by checkbox, searchbars and more. 

To achieve the interactive map, we used Leaflet API. This allowed us to use filters, draw markers on the neighborhoods and crime locations and more. We also used the nominatim API and our own API from earlier in the semester. Our API is derived from Saint Paul's API, but we build the functionality to do PUT, DELETE and PULL requests to the database. Using this API, we were able to take code that only worked in curl or the command line and implement it into a complex website. During this process, we gained valuable knowledge on APIs, how databases are queried from a user interface and much more. 

We also used VUE.js which was very helpful in building our user interface. From this project, I think I grew not only in my skill set, but I feel that I gained valuable experience in completing and excelling at a challenging project. Going into the project, I was intimidated because I knew it was a hard project which would require large investments in time and learning. In the end, however, I am very proud of the final product and of how my teammates and I worked together to accomplish a difficult task. 

I think this project is another great example of how computer science can be applied and can contribute to the common good. Our project delivers a crime tracking website that can be used by residents of Saint Paul to stay informed on crime statistics and trends. It is important to keep transparent crime statistcis and I think an interactive map like this is one of the most digestable ways to interpret said statistics and data.

+++++SPORTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE PAPER+++++

Another project I am proud of is a paper I wrote in my Sports and Social Justice course. This project is outside of the realm of computer science, but I think holds as much importance. 

My sports and social justice class was a very unique course, which studied how sports and social justice have historically meshed and how they do in the modern era. Furthermore, the course analyzed the effect of sports on society and spotlighted how impactful sports events can be on society. There are many examples of this. All the time, athletes make a stand or a statement about corrupt governments, injustices and more going on in the world. Athletes also make statements in their performances. An example of this is early 20th century boxer Jack Johnson or Jackie Robinson. Both of these athletes used sports as a  form of active protest and their greatness in and outside of the sports arena changed the world. 

The paper I am specifically going to reference deals with a story of a marathon runner and her experience on 9/11, 2001. This paper is an analysis of her rhetoric and exemplifies on of the categories I feel I grew in during this course. One of the things I enjoyed most about the course was taking a deep look into stories and books.

The paper is below: 

It’s Not That Kind of Day

	The article “Beneath 9/11’s Terrible Smoke, a Flash of Gold” follows the experience of a Washington Post journalist named Sally Jenkins. Rather than just covering the brutal facts of that day, Jenkins details her own personal experience. Jenkins gives a first person account on the terrifying and eerie events she witnessed that day. The story is both beautiful and horrific. It is beautiful in its ability to show how good overcame evil that day. Despite the massive acts of evil, there were thousands of acts of kindness and courage to help one another. Most of those stories will never be heard, but their impact is still felt today. One of those acts came from a bike shop owner, who gave Jenkins a 1970s lemon yellow bike for only $20. And why did he choose to do this? Because it was “not that kind of day.” It was not the sort of day for people to be concerned about money or property. In that kind of situation, what does any of that matter? When faced with death and destruction, all of New York came together in such a powerful way that their unity echoed throughout the world. They came together and cared for one another. They didn’t allow the gruesome attack on the Twin Towers to break them. Instead, they chose to choose their own destiny and come together. They chose to build a stronger community because of it. In this story, Jenkins elegantly portrays this unity and love. Jenkins employs a wide array of rhetorical techniques to expertly craft her story. By doing this, Jenkins is able to get her narrative across clearly and powerfully. 
	One of the first rhetorical techniques that really jumped out to me was her employment of persona techniques. Jenkins quickly establishes herself as a credible and trustworthy source because she was there. Not only that, but she was nearly at the heart of it all. “Had I not worn the spouse’s sandals and forgotten where I put them, we would’ve been near the foot of it.” (Jenkins 207). This is not only an eerie and heartbreaking realization, but it shows just how close she was to the attack. Jenkins surely had friends and co-workers who were there, at the foot of it all. Her persona is further developed with her use of first person pronouns. She uses words like “I”, or “we” and commonly includes quotes describing the thoughts going through her head as the events unfolded. This is also coupled with lots of metaphors and similes about what she saw. These would not likely be able to be replicated by someone who wasn’t there as they are all powerful and concise in their descriptions. One example that stuck out was, “When the first tower fell, it looked like God took his thumb and just rubbed it out of the picture. The inarticulate noises that came out of our throats were not screams exactly, just low exhalations of grieved astonishment.” (Jenkins 208). This segment beautifully shows her use of figurative language while simultaneously showing the terror she experienced. She uses many techniques to establish her persona, but none are as powerful as the events she describes in first person. Her metaphors bring the words to life, striking fear and sadness to the hearts of anyone.
	Jenkins also does a great job of using ethos and pathos in order to get her point across. But what is that point? The point she consistently hints at and then analyzes towards the end of the article is that we are constantly in a situation of facing good or evil. We may not see the evil as evil, but it can be “smaller self inflicted hairline cracks, our own responses to each other in storms, sickness and mean political seasons.” (Jenkins 212). She pushes back against the commonly held misconception that evil only takes roots in events like 9/11. While it certainly does and 9/11 was an act of sheer evil, the day to day evil is what will build up more than anything else can. To say that everyday evil is more of a problem than that which occurred on 9/11 would be a bold statement for someone who wasn’t there. But, Jenkins was. I mentioned previously that she uses ethos by using first person pronouns and describing her experiences first hand and with a lot of figurative language. This all establishes her as a credible source and one that knows more than most of us about the event. You could spend a lifetime researching every detail about 9/11 and still know nothing about how it felt to be there. This is an important distinction and one that strongly shows her credibility. In regards to pathos, she also represents a ton of loaded emotional testimony in her metaphors and observations. She is able to efficiently convey the horror of 9/11 and do so in a way that evokes empathy. A heartbreaking example is “Sometimes people just stood stock still in the streets with tears rolling down their faces.” (Jenkins 211). Jenkins interestingly noted not only how people looked running from the site and the day of, but also how people reacted afterwards. She noted how the city reacted. This point helped her develop her article and the point of it. When she was noting how the city reacted, a common topic was how much people helped each other. How during these tragic times, the city came together because “It wasn't that kind of day.” This is the point that she moves towards. It should never be the kind of day where we let stupid evils of the world divide us. And how powerful is it that a 9/11 survivor is able to say that is the true evil we need to face most. She saw true evil in 9/11 but saw true good in those who helped each other. 
	Finally, I’d like to talk about intent. Jenkin’s intent was quite clear as the story moved on. It was not to gain pity or praise, but to use her grief, pain and loss to provide wisdom for the world. She got a glimpse of what the world could look like if we all had the attitude of “It’s not that kind of day.” and saw how powerful it could be. For months and even years after 9/11 the country united like it hadn’t in decades. Jenkins wrote this article on September 11th, 2021 a time where many people viewed the country as the most divided it has ever been. To have lived in a time where the country was the most and the least united in the span of twenty years must be heartbreaking. I think Jenkin believes we can get back to that utopia. As she notes, “We have to free-handedly do something small and good and kind every day because, hey, it’s not that kind of day.”(Jenkins 212).  She is saying that we must look out for each other. Our nature conditions us to care only about ourselves and our immediate family but we must do more if we want to live in a better society. We must care about the guy on the corner, the person who’s politics are different from ours and the random people we cross every day. What kind of chain reaction can we make if even just a few of us do kind acts everyday. How have you felt when someone, especially a stranger went out of their way to help you? You felt inspired, didn’t you? I think what she is precisely and elegantly trying to say is what kind of world could we make if we all did this?

This class and paper both contribute to the common good in profound ways. The class gives students a very unique perspective and education on topics related to social justice. I think this is really valueable as it helps build knowledge around these important topics and helps students approach issues from more educated and analytical perspectives. This paper helped me develop some of those skills by really diving into what the author was saying and attempting to understand what she wanted to say, why and to who.

+++++CONCLUSION+++++

As I look towards the end of my college career, I am grateful for all of the new experiences I've had and for things I got to learn. It has been a privilige to study at the University of St. Thomas and work closely with peers and faculty. I have gained a unique and diverse spectrum of knowledge and I feel that the classes I took outside of CS were just as valuable as those I learned within computer science.
